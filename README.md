Bash-script for Certain operations will be added into this branch.
I will add my own automations over the years as much as i can remember :) and i hope this helps anyone who needs such simple scripts.

* Please check the comments in the scripts or the detailed info on top of each script.
I have Also added few comments time to time due to suggestion of friends.

** Please leave your Comment if you Like and help me if you think any of these scripts could be better.
much love and respect to my betters and friends :)

cheers
